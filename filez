   keyloop - basic CRT loop which checks for a key each iteration
             if a key is pressed everything restarts
             at the top of the loop the background colour is changed briefly
             there is a delay (delay1) between the loop top and keyboard check
             there is a delay (delay2) between the keyboard check and loop top
             there is a delay (delay3) before the first iteration of the loop
             keys are as follows:
                W = delay1 += 1
                E = delay2 -= 1
                R = delay1 += 4
                T = delay2 -= 4
                Y = delay3 += 1
                U = delay3 += 4
             Basically W,E move the keyboard handler to the right one cycle
                       R,T move the keyboard handler to the right four cycles
                       Y moves the background register write to the right one cycle
                       U moves the background register write to the right four cycles
             Note: keys that increment by 1 do so in limited range, usually 0-6 or so
                   going outside the range will result in unpredicatable results
                   press keys for incrementing by 4 for larger jumps

   hordisp - code for experimenting with changing the horiz. disp. reg. from 40 to some value
             keys are as above with the following additions:
                I = switch from setting bg reg to setting horiz disp reg
                O = increment value of horiz. disp. reg. (starts at 0)
                P = delay3 -= 1
                [ = delay3 -= 4
                ] = switch from setting horiz disp reg to setting bg reg
             Note: keys that decrement by 1 do so in limited range, usually 0-6 or so
                   going outside the range will result in unpredicatable results
                   press keys for decrementing by 4 for larger jumps
